Edit the front-end display of the pricing for the products in your Woocommerce store.

== Description ==
Easy to use!

Gives you the ability on each individual product page to add text before and/or after the price of the item.

It's hooked into the price display so will match the style of your exisiting website.

Does not affect the actual price value so it will not interfere with cart calculations.

Works on product archives and single product pages.

Works for all product types.

Will display anywhere the price is diplayed.
(*If using facebook for woocommerce, when linking products to a facebook shop, only the price value is pulled into facebook.)

Super lightweight plugin won't slow down your website.
